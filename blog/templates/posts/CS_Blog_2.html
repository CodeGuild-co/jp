                <p>What I have learnt so far is that software engineering is all about being lazy, which to most people is rather controversial, seeing as it is a word with negative condescendence but it is not as first seems. The key to software engineering is being efficient with the time you spend writing your programme but also with the time the user will spend using the programme. There is no use in spending hours writing code which has already been written so feel free to use it. You want your programme to be as simple as possible while still achieving the task at hand to the specification required. Knowing where to start is task in itself, similar to writing a blog!</p>
